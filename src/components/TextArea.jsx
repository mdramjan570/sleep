        <p className="text-justify ">
          Insomnia can be defined as the inability to fall asleep at night. Most
          cases of insomnia can be transient and usually pass without the need
          for medical treatment but in some cases the problem can become
          chronic, which can cause a negative impact on life during waking
          hours. A person may be regarded as suffering from chronic insomnia if
          experiencing sleep problems 3 times per week or more and for 3 months
          or longer and to resolve this issue, many people rely on sleeping
          tablets to get to sleep at night.

        <h3 className="text-xl text-[#002039] font-bold"> Types of Insomnia</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          There are a number of sleeping problems that may be defined as
          insomnia. These include problems falling asleep at night, waking up
          frequently throughout the night, or waking too early in the morning.
          These types of sleeping problems often leave sufferers feeling tired
          throughout the following day, resulting in under performance at work,
          lethargy and a general lack of drive and concentration

        <h3 className="text-xl text-[#002039] font-bold">Causes of Insomnia</h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          There are a number of factors that may cause insomnia. Often, medical
          conditions can trigger periods of sleeplessness. These may include
          back pain, arthritis, gastrointestinal problems and sleep apnoea. Some
          medications are also known to cause sleep problems including medicines
          for the treatment of high blood pressure, asthma, nasal allergies and
          depression. Psychological factors can also be a major cause of
          sleeping disorders. Conditions such as anxiety, stress and depression
          often make it hard to fall asleep at night and many people resort to
          using sleeping tablets to get a good night's sleep. Sometimes, a
          recent traumatic experience or worrying about financial matters or
          relationship problems can make it difficult to fall asleep at night.
          In fact, around half of all cases of insomnia arise as a result of
          psychological stress.

          Can Sleeping Pills be Ordered Online to Treat Insomnia?{" "}
        </h3>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The answer to this question is yes, but some precautions are
          recommended before deciding to do so. All attempts to treat insomnia
          naturally with basic lifestyle changes should be exhausted first but
          if sleeping problems become chronic, using sleeping pills short-term
          can be an effective way to stop the cycle of sleeplessness. It should
          also be established that the website selling the sleeping tablets is a
          reputable one. All sleeping tablets available for sale should be
          licensed medications that have been deemed safe and effective for the
          treatment of insomnia problems.
